## Development Workflow

This is a documentation-only repository with no build process, tests, or compilation steps. Changes are typically:
1. Content updates to existing markdown files
2. Adding new books, courses, or certifications to the appropriate lists
3. Maintaining chronological order in Training.md
4. Organizing content by relevant categories in Books.md

## Git Workflow

- Main branch: `master`
- Direct commits to master for documentation updates
- No formal review process required for personal documentation
- Standard git operations: add, commit, push

## File Maintenance Guidelines

- Keep Training.md in reverse chronological order (newest first)
- Maintain consistent formatting and linking patterns
- Include completion dates and certification URLs where available
- Organize Books.md content by logical professional development categories
- Preserve existing markdown structure and formatting conventions
